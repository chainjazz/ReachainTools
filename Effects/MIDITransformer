desc:Peak Reduction Calculator

// BY RASTKO
// TODO
// [ ] Create test scripts to maximize performance (minimize CPU cycles)
//  - especially concnetrate on the @block et al.
// Kind of cool these script effects right? Back to basics (the first
// thing that sparked my interest in programming was a crude DSP for
// Winamp)
// [ ] NOTE this are not the same as ReaScript (for Actions)
// but is probably similar in language support
